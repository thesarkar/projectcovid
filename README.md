# projectcovid

The Project COVID is a Data exploration project in SQL. In this case, the data to explore is COVID-19's global report. 
The report includes information of new cases, total cases, new deaths, total deaths, new COVID-19 tests, total COVID-19 tests, and vaccinations done etc.
The analysis is done on the original unstructured data set "owid-covid-data.csv" file and two separate data sets are extracted from it:-
  1) Covid-Deaths.xslx
  2) Covid-Vaccination.xslx
 These two data sets are loaded in SQL database and separate queries are performed in order to make analysis and get meaningful data from it.
 All the queries ran are stored in Data Exploration in SQL.sql file
 
 Data analysis begins with data exploration, where an unstructured large data set is explored.
 Exploratory data analysis is performed to make sense of the data, manipulate the available data source so that the major points to study can be easily visualized using visualization tools.
 The exploration is done in order to comprehend complex data by uncovering initial patterns, characteristics, and points of interest.
 The main aim is to try and create a big picture of important trends rather than reveal every minute detail present in the data set.
